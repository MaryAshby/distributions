  <h1>What <i>IS</i> a Distribution</h1>
  <p> 
    In chapter seven of his book, <u>The Truthful Art</u>, Cairo explains various ways of visualizing distributions. 
    A distribution is all the data in a set visualized to show how the data points relate to each other. The "standard normal distribution"
    is the easily recognized, bell curve. Other data sets may not fall on this curve. To look at the distribution, examine the:
    level, spread, shape, and outliers of the data.</p>
  <h3>Level</h3>
  <p>The level "measures the central tendency, such as the mean" (Cairo, p. 194). The level represents the "norm" of the data as discussed 
  in chapter six. </p>
  
  <h3>Spread</h3>
 <p> Although it may immediately conjure thoughts of betting, the spread represents the range of data in the set.</p>
  
  <h3>Shape</h3>
<p>  The shape of the data refers to how it is arranged. When plotted, the data may appear symmetrical or skewed (weighted). A bell chart is an
  example of a symmetrical shape.</p>
  
  <h3>Outliers</h3>
  <p>  As mentioned in chapter six of <u>The Truthful Art</u>, outliers are data points that fall far from the norm, and thus may 
    skew the data in ways that obfuscate the understanding of the data (Cairo, p. 155). The box-and-whisker example Cairo shows on page 
    193 gives a good visualization of the outliers in the data.</p>
  
  <h3>Example</h3>
<p>In the radar chart below, Stressors vs. Guinness (not actual Guinness consumption), the shape of the data is quickly visible; it is not 
  symmetrical. In addition, outliers are also quick to be seen, such as the low Guinness consumption at the full moon and when there is a cat around.</p>
